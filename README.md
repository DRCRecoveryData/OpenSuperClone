## ‚ú® Features

* Advanced drive cloning capability akin to that of ddrescue
* Virtual drive mode for targeted data extraction
* Direct AHCI and IDE capability to circumvent OS drivers completely
* USB relay control for automatic power cycling of drives

#### üìã Planned Changes

* Refactoring of codebase (get rid of -fcommon flag)
* Remove requirement for running as root
* Add configuration files and presets for settings

## üíæ Installation

Pre-built DEB and RPM packages for OpenSuperClone can be found on the <a href=https://github.com/ISpillMyDrink/OpenSuperClone/releases>Release</a> page.

Note that OpenSuperClone requires a kernel module to be installed for the virtual drive functionality and direct AHCI/IDE access. If `DKMS` is present,
the module will be automatically built and installed. Otherwise, the module can be built and installed manually.

```Bash

# Build and install the kernel module manually (substitute x.x.x with the version number)
$ cd /usr/src/OSCDriver-x.x.x
$ make
$ sudo make install

# Alternatively, build and install the kernel module using DKMS
# after the package has been installed (requires DKMS to be installed)
$ sudo dkms install OSCDriver/x.x.x

```

### Compiling from Source

üí° OpenSuperClone requires the following packages to be installed for a successful project build:

- `cmake`
- `gcc`
- `gettext`
- `libconfig-dev`
- `libgtk-3-dev`
- `libusb-dev`
- `pkg-config`

#### Building and running locally

```Bash
# Build OpenSuperClone and OSCViewer for Release and install to ./Release
$ ./build.sh

# If you want to install the kernel module with DKMS, copy the source to the DKMS directory
# and install the module (substitute x.x.x with the version number)
sudo cp -r ./Release/src/OSCDriver-x.x.x /usr/src/OSCDriver-x.x.x
sudo dkms install OSCDriver/x.x.x

# Run OpenSuperClone
$ sudo ./Release/bin/opensuperclone

# Run OSCViewer
$ ./Release/bin/oscviewer
```

#### Building and installing to /usr/

```Bash
# Build OpenSuperClone and OSCViewer for Release and install to /usr/
# This will also attempt to install the kernel module if DKMS is installed
$ ./install.sh

# Run OpenSuperClone
$ sudo opensuperclone

# Run OSCViewer
$ oscviewer
```
